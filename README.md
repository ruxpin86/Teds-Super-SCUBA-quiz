# Teds-super-SCUBA-quiz

This will be a truly epic and most excellent quiz! In this I will conquer the dragons of JS and my fears of jQuery by showcasing my Google Fu! Wanna test your SCUBA knowledge? Wanna learn a little something about SCUBA? Well then take this fun little quiz and test your SCUBA chops.

This was a doozy. We were tasked with making a quiz game for our fourth challenge project. In this project we needed to first and foremost use an object of ARRAYS to store our questions and answers to be manipulated with JS in the DOM. I struggled at first getting my data structure correct with the questionArray object, but was able to persevere through trial and error (and also thank-you Ben for the nudge). The next most challenging aspect of this project was understanding how to call those array objects in sequence on an event listener, and link them to the timer by having it decrement upon an incorrect answer.

After I accomplished the aforementioned task I tackled having to handle the end game. Logging scores in local storage and then having them display persistently was also a question that required some serious Googling. The page itself is nothing special... but I'm pleased with the functionality.

SCUBA STEVE! DAMN YOU!
